# Rubik's Cube in Python

## Project Overview

Hey everyone!

Welcome to our Rubik's Cube project! I’m excited to dive into creating a fun and functional Rubik's Cube simulator in Python together. The idea here is to provide a platform where we can all implement our own logic, control mechanisms, and solvers while exploring the intricacies of the Rubik's Cube.

## Features

- **Cube Representation**: We'll have a class that represents the Rubik's Cube using a 2D list to hold the square values.
- **Coloring Support**: For a bit of flair, there's a CLI printing class (`color.py`) to help visualize the cube in the terminal.
- **Custom Logic**: Everyone can write their own code to manipulate the cube's state, simulating those real-life moves we all know.
- **Control Interface**: A command-line interface (CLI) will let us input commands to control the cube and test our logic.
- **Solver Class**: There will be a solver class that takes the current state of the cube and attempts to solve it automatically, drawing inspiration from various solving techniques you can find on youtube videos.
- **Learning and Fun**: At the core, this project is all about learning and having fun. We can experiment with different approaches to solving the cube and see what works best.

## Working Hours

We’ll be collaborating five days a week, from Monday to Friday, during the day in the EU timezone. Most of our communication will happen via voice on our Discord server, which should make it easy to bounce ideas around. And don’t worry—you don’t have to attend coding sessions every day; just pop in when you can!

## Contribution Guidelines

I encourage all of you to jump in and contribute! Feel free to create your own versions of the control logic, solvers, or any other cool features you’d like to implement.

### Speed Tests

I’m also looking forward to future competitions where we can test our solvers against each other and see whose implementation can solve 100+ cubes the fastest. Let’s get creative and see how fast we can make our solvers!

## Acknowledgments

Thanks for being part of this journey! I’m really looking forward to seeing what we can create together. Let’s make this project a fun and educational experience for everyone involved.
